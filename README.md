# Mindfucking Shell Scripts

#### This is my personal collection of Shell Scripts I've created (or copied) just for
general trolling purposes. Nothing harmful or permanent, just some office jokes :)

* [cronmagic.sh](https://github.com/lucasviola/mindfuck-shell/blob/master/.cronmagic.sh)
`So in the office we have this friendly dispute among devs to see who
has the highest github number of commits in the project. Since we work in pairs, 
devs are always fighting each other to see whos gonna get the commit this time, and that's why I
created this little script. It creates a file with my github info and changes every 5 minutes or so
using CRON scheduled tasks. It's a daemon, so the ony way for discoering this is checking crontab or
printing the logs :)`
